<h2>
CCAUS / COMBILITY DEVICE:
</h2>

<h3>
CCAUS
</h3>

(Controlled Combility Actions Universal System)

A combination of:

    - An main exterior visual shell, or model, we call the CCAUS Device. 
    - Holds one or more combilities and interacts with our controller/input systems
    - Maps input controllers to combility actions & fire rates etc. 
    - Attaches to a slot. 

<h3>
Combility
</h3>

(Combination of Abilities)

- A combination of mods that work together to form an ability.
- Needs 3 mods (minimum, but no maximum) to form a valid combility.
    - A Action(s) / Attribute(s) mod. 
    - Target Type Mod (Which type of object/enemy/ally does this combility work on)
    - Path Shape (Shape of the projectile/form, including its range)
- May compile the visuals & audio of each individual mod into a singular graphic & sound. 


<h3>Mod </h3>
- An individual Action or Attribute
- May include graphics / sounds. 

<h3>Mod Mix: </h3>
- A loose collection of mods assembled by the player that, by itself, is non-functional (as it lacks the necessary target types or path shapes to form a functional combility). 


<h3>Combilities: </h3>

More than one Combility.

<h3>Slot (CCAUS Slot):</h3>

- The interface where a CCAUS/Combility can attach or generate from a character/object/enemy. 

- For Energy Game: Energy-port on your armor that can generate combilities. 

<h3>Loadout (Energy Game): </h3>

- A colored rod, that is stored inside of a Loadout Slot and is placed into your core when you want to swap to that loadout. 

- Contains a set of CCAUS Devices for all of your slots on your armor. 
    - So if you swap out one loadout for another, all of the CCAUS devices in all of your slots swap at once. 

<h3> Loadout Slot (Energy Game):</h3>

- One of 8 holes in each of your arms, that contains a "loadout" container. 


<h2>
Skillbility: 
</h2>

(Takes Skill to perform A Combility using a specialized CCAUS Trigger system that takes requires a skill to perform the action(s))

Skill-Based Combilities:
- Parrying a shot, 
- Shooting center of a bubble shield
- All of the Realbilities

<h2>
Movbility: 
</h2>

(A movement-based combility, almost always triggered by moving at the correct motion before initiating the movbility. Often initiated by thumbstick movements, but can also be initiated by realbilities)

In-game movement abilities:
- Walking
- Sprinting
- Dodging
- Mid-air dodging
- Landing a Fall
- Jumping
- Wall Running
- Wall Climbing

<h2>
Realbility: 
</h2>

(Physical movement based-CCAUS to trigger the abilities)

Moving IRL to accomplish in-game actions at 0 energy cost (because you are using energy/coordination/exercise IRL). Any combility could be a realbility. But the most likely used candidates would be the Movbilities.

<h3>examples: </h3>

- Dodging IRL to dodge huge in game.
    - Left/right/forward/backward dodges
    - jump for upward dodge if in air, or jump if on ground
    - crouch for downward dodge if in air, and low crouch if on ground. 

- Crouching IRL to do a super-low crouch in game.
    - Crouching at the right time when falling to land with 0 damage/energy loss. 
- Jumping IRL to do super jump-dodge in game. 
- Walking/Running in place to do the same in game. 


How to categorize these?:
- Parrying bullets... Do you need energy to do this or not? It is a IRL skill, but then again, so is aiming a weapon.... 


<h2>
Corebility:
</h2>

- Possibly spawn in with less max capacity by spawning in early. 
- Self Destruction

<h2>
Swap Combilities:
</h2>

(See my notes in EG controls spreadsheet)

<h2>
Swap Loadouts:
</h2>

(see my notes in eg controls spreadsheet)

- Swapping loadouts via the rods in your R arm.
- Accessing even more loadouts/options via a cog wheel on your r arm.
