## Project Description

This GitHub repository hosts the source code for a Tower Defense game developed using the Ursina game engine. Tower Defense games are popular for their strategic gameplay, and this project offers a unique take on the genre. In this game, players are tasked with defending a path against oncoming waves of enemies by strategically placing defensive towers.

### Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engage in a dynamic and interactive Tower Defense experience where you can click to place and upgrade towers to fend off waves of enemies.

- **Pathfinding**: Implement a pathfinding algorithm to guide the enemies along a defined route on the grid, providing a challenging gaming experience.

- **Basic Lighting**: Enhance the visual appeal of the game with the Ursina basic lighting shader, creating a realistic 3D environment.

- **Tower Placement**: Strategically place and upgrade your defensive towers to maximize their effectiveness against incoming enemies. (Not ready yet)

- **Interactive Environment**: Click on the grid to interact with the game world. Select and highlight specific cubes to mark your path or place towers.

- **Camera Control**: The game features an EditorCamera that allows you to view the game world from a top-down perspective, giving you a clear view of the battlefield.
### How to Play

1. Run the game and observe the 3D environment with its grid-based terrain.
2. Click on the cubes to select and highlight the path for your enemies.
3. Place towers to defend the path and defeat incoming waves of enemies. ((Not ready yet)
