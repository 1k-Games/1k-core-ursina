<h1>
Allbilities
</h1>

<h2>
Combility:
</h2>

A combination of:
  - A trigger-control system
  - Any combination of other mods, Mod Mixes, or other Combilities
  - Models, Animations, & Sounds to support it


This is attached to a slot. Allows you to use weapons/tools/abilities.  

Other names: a Combination of Abilities, Combility Device/Tool/Tech/Weapon, or Co-Mod, CombiMods, Combactions. 

<h3>Mods/Actions/Abilities: </h3>

Individual abilities or properties that can modify the energy output of your device. Build together to form a Mod Mix or a Combility (Combination of Abilities). 

<h3>Mod Mix: </h3>

A combination of several mods, that are grouped together by the user, but does nothing until you combine them into a combility, with or without other mods & mod mixes (not trigger control system, etc).

<h3>Combilities: </h3>

More than one Combility.

<h3>Slot:</h3>

Energy-port on your armor that can generate combilities. 

<h3>Loadout: </h3>

- Contains a pre-determined Combility in each of the 8+ slots.
- Switching a loadout means that all 8 slots change their combilities at once. 

<h2>
Skillbility: 
</h2>

Actions that take skills to perform for benefits:
- Parrying a shot, 
- Shooting center of a bubble shield
- All of the Realbilities

<h2>
Movbility: 
</h2>

In-game movement abilities.
These are actually all mod mixes that have a different control trigger system than their combility counterparts. Triggered via combinations of stick movements primarily. 

- Walking
- Sprinting
- Dodging (Flick & quickly let go of stick)
- Mid-air dodging (flick and quickly let go of stick)
- Landing a Fall
- Jumping
- Wall Jumping (jumping off a wall for greater height)
- Wall Running
- Wall Climbing

<h2>
Realbility: 
</h2>

Moving IRL to accomplish in-game actions at 0 energy cost (because you are using energy/coordination/exercise IRL). Almost all Movbilities can be Realbilities. Maybe some other abilities that aren't Movbitlities could be candidates as well. 

<h3>examples: </h3>

- Dodging IRL to dodge huge in game.
    - Left/right/forward/backward dodges
    - jump for upward dodge if in air, or jump if on ground
    - crouch for downward dodge if in air, and low crouch if on ground. 

- Crouching IRL to do a super-low crouch in game.
    - Crouching at the right time when falling to land with 0 damage/energy loss. 
- Jumping IRL to do super jump-dodge in game. 
- Walking/Running in place to do the same in game. 


How to categorize these?:
- Parrying bullets... Do you need energy to do this or not? It is a IRL skill, but then again, so is aiming a weapon.... 


<h2>
Corebility:
</h2>

- Possibly spawn in with less max capacity by spawning in early. 
- Self Destruction

<h2>

(See my notes in EG controls spreadsheet)

<h2>
